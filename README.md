# ast-comments

An extension to the built-in `ast` module. 
Finds comments in source code and adds them to the parsed tree.

## Installation
```
pip install ast-comments
```

## Usage

There is no difference in usage between `ast` and `ast-comments`
```
>>> from ast_comments import *
>>> tree = parse("hello = 'hello' # comment to hello")
```
Parsed tree is instance of the original ast.Module object.
The only difference is there is a new type of tree node: Comment
```
>>> tree
<_ast.Module object at 0x7ffba52322e0>
>>> tree.body
[<ast_comments.Comment object at 0x10c1b6160>, <_ast.Assign object at 0x10bd217c0>]
>>> tree.body[0].value
'# comment to hello'
>>> dump(tree)
"Module(body=[Comment(value='# comment to hello'), Assign(targets=[Name(id='hello', ctx=Store())], value=Constant(value='hello', kind=None), type_comment=None)], type_ignores=[])"
```
If you have python3.9 or above it's also possible to unparse the tree object with its comments preserved.
```
>>> print(unparse(tree))
# comment to hello
hello = 'hello'
```
More examples can be found in test_parse.py and test_unparse.py.
